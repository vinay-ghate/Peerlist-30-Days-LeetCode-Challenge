You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        x = prices[0]  # Buying Price
        y = 0  # Profit
        for i in range(1,len(prices)):
            x = min(x,prices[i])
            if prices[i]-x>y:
                y=prices[i]-x
        return y
